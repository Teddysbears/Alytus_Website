# Alytus_Website
The Alytus website project is a news site like many websites, but we generate value to Alytus news, because it gathers news from four news site. Weâ€™re adding keywords to those and if we can also add coordinates, then pin news to map. All the features that we were adding improve the value of our website and help people to be aware of Alytus news. Furthermore, we will include some extra features.


## How to launch our project: 

### First step
  Launch mongodb database with **mongod** in a terminal.

### Second step
  Launch the server in /Alytus_Website/Website with : **npm run start**.
  
### Third step
